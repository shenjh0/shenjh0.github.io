I am a co-founder of the [Imperial Maths Competition](https://icmathscomp.org/index.html) (IMC). This is a student-led Maths challenge co-hosted by the [Imperial College MathSoc](https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcsu/mathsoc/about19-20) and Maths societies in many other UK universities. Founded in Autumn 2017, IMC aims to provide a platform for all UK undergraduates/Master's students with an opportunity to enjoy Olympiad-like Mathematics. The 2019-2020 Round One has finished and the solution is available [here](https://icmathscomp.org/round-one-solutions.html). For more information about this competition, please visit our [website](https://icmathscomp.org/index.html).
